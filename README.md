### Hi there!!! 👋

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

I’m a rising undergraduate studying Computer Science who has always loved technology and keeping up with the latest frameworks/tools. I am interested in Software and Web Development, Mobile App Development, Cloud computing, DevOps, Cybersecurity, and Artificial Intelligence.
I’m becoming a better engineer by practicing new skills and building new projects. After I receive my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I plan on earning a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence. 

Outside of building and programming, I enjoy reading and traveling.
