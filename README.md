### Hi there!!! 👋

<!--
**ashamarieparke/AshamarieParke** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

I’m a undergraduate studying Computer Science who has always loved technology and keeping up with the latest frameworks/tools. I am interested in Software and Full Stack Development, Mobile App Development, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence.
I’m becoming a better engineer by practicing new skills and building new projects. After I receive my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I plan on earning a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence. 

Outside of building and programming, I enjoy reading and playing Animal Crossing. 

Thank you for viewing my GitHub!
